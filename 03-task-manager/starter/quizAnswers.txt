Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

I think middleware can help us to write much more cleaner code and preventing from duplicating a functionality. Middleware
can access request object and response object, and many middlewares can be joined by next(), this next() should be called at the
end of our middleware function to stop the process.
Also there are bultin middlewares which we can use them in our code, the one which the instructor used was Morgan(tiny).

What does CRUD stand for? Create , Read , Update , Delete
You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.

How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file? 
to access the .env file
step1: assign a parameter (url) to our function(connectDB) and put it in mongoose.connect to return it.
step2: to access those secret variable we simply need to require that variable. require('dotenv').config()
step3: for passing in that value from .env to connectDB, we can use the process.env.variableName as connectDB function parameter which it makes the .env file accessible anywhere in our application.

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
I will put the .env file into .gitignore file to be ignored when pushing my assignment to my github account.
